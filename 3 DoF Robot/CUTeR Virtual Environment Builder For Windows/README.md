    - After adding trajectory to object and turn on the switch. Once you click the start trajectory button on the top of the screen, the object will act as the added trajectory.
    - The object will ignore all physical rules but move as the trajectory described.
    - A solid object (with rigidbody) will stop if it pass the grab point (the semi-transparent cube on the head of the grabber) for you to grab. The object will continue its movement if you just move the robot arm and let the object leave the grab point.
